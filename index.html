                            <h2 class="display-4">New Philly Store</h2>
                            <p><b>The Problem:</b> Find an area for a new healthy food store in Philadelphia that is near a public transport station, far enough away from other healthy food stores and markets and is a large enough space.
<p><b>The Plan:</b> I knew I needed to split the problem into 2 main groups, the areas where it couldn’t be and the areas where it could. Then from there I could overlay the two and find all available spaces. For both sub groups it involved buffering the variables to map a distance around and create the usable spaces dissolved from that. When I had both inclusive and exclusive I could overlay them and using the erase tool I was able to dissolve the spaces that meet all the criteria then separate them into multiple shapes. To find the largest area I generated the area field for my valid shapes and determined the highest to lowest values. To create the layout for my map I used unique value symbology to show the areas for each color coded valid shape.</p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b> There were 5 areas that met the criteria and had the following areas in square feet: Red: 3,760 sq. ft., Purple: 17,431 sq. ft., Pink: 44,506 sq. ft., Blue: 1,090,003 sq. ft., Green: 4,049,487 sq. ft. I determined that the best area for the new store is the green space because it has the largest available area that fits all the criteria.</p>
<p><b>What I learned in GIS:</b> I learned how to use multiple new tools such as buffering, dissolving, and overlaying data to map specific areas that meet sets of criteria.

<p><b>The problem:</b> Show the spatial distribution of the density of homicides (per square mile) in Chicago by police district.</p>
<p><b>The Plan:</b> I needed to convert the UTM coordinate system to best display the chicago area so I looked up the UTM zone for chicago which is NAD1983 UTM Zone 16N and changed the map to fit that using the project tool and tweaking the coordinate systems tab of the maps. I selected only the crimes involving homicide by using select by attribute, then I used the summarize tool to get the frequencies of homicides in each district. I then joined the created frequency table with the district map using the district variable as a joiner. I added the square miles column to the table using calculate geometry then calculated the density using the calculate field tool. Finally I used the frequency and square miles area fields to create a choropleth map to show frequency density in each district.</p>
<p><b>What I learned in GIS:</b> I learned how to join 2 tables’ data together, as well as summarizing and adding data layers to the tables and making new values such as coding x over y statistics like population density.</p>

                            <h2 class="display-4">US Census Hispanic Population</h2>
<p><b>The problem:</b> Describe the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the US according to the 2010 US Census </p>
<p><b>The Plan:</b> To get the list of states that fall under the specific categories I looked at the attribute table for the census data and sorted by descending and ascending Hispanic population size. For the states that have a greater Hispanic population than the lowest pop state (Wyoming) I looked up Wyoming's population and then selected all states that have a Hispanic population above that. To make the map I used the symbology pane and inputted hispanic population as the field, total population as the normalization, and graduated colors as the symbol type. I then tweaked the color and set the classification to natural breaks to make it look presentable. To display the map I added it to a layout and inserted the different map elements. I tweaked the legend by ungrouping the assets to reformat the quantitative data shown, specifically adding less than/equal to signs and converting the data into percentages.</p>
<p><b>The solution:</b>The five states that have the highest number of Hispanics, and the Hispanic population of each are: California: 14,013,719. Texas: 9,460,921. Florida: 4,223,806. New York: 3,416,922. and Illinois: 2,027,578. The states whose Hispanic population is greater than the total population of the least populous state in the US include: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Arizona, New Jersey, Colorado, New Mexico, Georgia, North Carolina, Washington, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Virginia, and Massachusetts.</p>
<p><b>What I learned in GIS:</b> With this map I learned how to use symbology in maps to make dot density, proportional symbol, and choropleth maps to display statistical geographic information. I also learned how to tweak layout inserts like legends to better display numerical statistics.</p>
